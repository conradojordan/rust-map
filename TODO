1. Add hashing implementation for String, so that it can be used as a key for the hash map
2. Add hashing implementation for float types
3. Make the number of buckets on the map grow dinamically
4. Add "remove()" method that removes element from the map
5. Add "items()" method that returns all the (key, value) tuples of the map
